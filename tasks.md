## Bugs:
- If we enter in a book, for example: goose girl
  - it gives mixed results
  - wrong google book api search result
  - correct, but doesn't match with Tastedive
    - maybe use wiki api instead?...
    - check out here https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page
- ~~If Search term not found, display error~~
- ~~fix so each book has their own image~~
- ~~**fix book search images so that they are in the right order**~~
- ~~seems like google api if multiple words are separated by %20 by default gives~~
  - entirely different results, changed to have + in between
- ~~if thumbnail does not exist, replace with temporary image~~
- ~~show-hide button not applied for all others, fix it later~~
- should account for cases when certain terms not found
  - example: author, imagelinks etc

## feedback questions
- Do my users think the app is interesting or valuable?
- Did my users use the app as I intended?
- Did my users encounter any bugs or broken features?
- Did my users understand how to use the app?

## feedback
- include some way to show reviews/ratings to give users more of incentive to try out
- Your app is valuable for those who want to search for books when they can't find any recommendation. I probably won't use it though because nowadays people do really read books. Unless you expand the app a bit to give a broader genres or search application with keywords to help find what they are looking for.
- make book recommendations, avoid same author, add more variety
- book descriptions looks messy
- change book preview to amazon page 
- make links that says amazon if it leads to amazon
- easy to use, no bugs
