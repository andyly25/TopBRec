- Did my users encounter any bugs or broken features?
- Did my users understand how to use the app?

## feedback
- include some way to show reviews/ratings to give users more of incentive to try out
- Your app is valuable for those who want to search for books when they can't find any recommendation. I probably won't use it though because nowadays people do really read books. Unless you expand the app a bit to give a broader genres or search application with keywords to help find what they are looking for.
- make book recommendations, avoid same author, add more variety
- book descriptions looks messy
  - maybe separate by periods and space with a `<br>` per sentence?
- change book preview to amazon page maybe
- make links that says amazon if it leads to amazon
- easy to use, no bugs
- add more genres
  - hardcover fiction (default), hardcover nonfiction, young adult hardcover
    - some more: Business, science, sports and fitness
- maybe add in number of search results as an option?
